# Horiseon-1-5-21-2022

## This is a Website about the Marketing Company Horiseon

This website for the most part is ready for deployment. I added accessibility features. I added semantic elements. I also changed the semantic elements to a more logical structure. I also added a title, and consolidated the CSS classes.
